## Description

In this chapter, we discuss about different types of training material formats and how they can help or hinder their reusability by you (the author) or others.  

!!! info "Learning outcomes"
    **At the end of this chapter you should be able to:**

     1. Identify most popular training material formats/types 
     2. Differentiate  interoperability and reusability by comparing formats/types
     3. Explain the relevance of annotating training material with minimal necessary information for reusability, having a README file, and using naming conventions.
     4. Explain the relevance of documenting training material for reusability

## Prerequisites
[Chapter 1](chapter_01.md) 

## What you will find here one day
* What are interoperable formats?
* Examples of different file formats and what makes them interoperable
* How will you ensure reproducibility / reusability of your materials by yourself and others
* Some best practices such as:
     * Giving a clear structure of your repository with folders and subfolders with a sounding (for you and others) name (naming files), using name conventions
     * Creating README file (GitHub) / Master Doc (GDrive): a document describing and linking all different small pieces of materials in a certain order Guidelines
