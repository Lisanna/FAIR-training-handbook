<!-- Chapter Types of training materials and their features related to the FAIR training -->

## Description

In this chapter, we discuss different types of training material formats and how they can facilitate or hinder their FAIRness. We also discuss the importance of annotating training material with the minimal necessary information and documenting as much as possible (e.g. by providing instructor notes and/or a lesson plan) for stand-alone re-usability. 

!!! info "Learning outcomes"
    **At the end of this chapter you should be able to:**

     1. Identify most popular training material formats/types 
     2. Identify material types and formats that facilitate interoperability and reusability
     3. Explain the relevance of annotating training material with minimal necessary information for interoperability and  reusability, having a README file, and using naming conventions.
     4. Explain the relevance of documenting (e.g. by providing instructor notes and/or a  lesson plan) for stand-alone re-usability 

## Prerequisites
[Chapter 1](chapter_01.md) 

## Training material formats/types

In Chapter 1, we used a “broad” definition of training materials as anything you would produce yourself (or reuse) as a support for your teaching activity. These can be slides, datasets, videos, software, a GitHub repo, a collection of exercises, Virtual Machines (VMs)/Containers, etc. In summary, any digital object that can be used to deliver a lesson, course, or curriculum. 

Each type of material can be captured in a variety of formats. Each format has advantages and disadvantages in terms of interoperability and (re)usability. Some formats facilitate interoperability, some facilitate (re)usability, some facilitate both. 

!!! example "Exercise"

     Identify possible formats for each type of material. Which format(s) do you mostly adopt? Why?

Table !!!! Add here !!!

!!! example "Exercise"

     Make a list of the most popular formats (according to your experience) and write, for each of them, main advantages and disadvantages in terms of FAIRness.
